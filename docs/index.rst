Welcome to documentation for LIMS Demo
===================================

**LIMS Demo** is full-stack project, built and deployed over the 
course of 1 week, which aims to showcase a minimum viable product 
for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
The intention behind this project is to demonstrate my development 
capabilities, especially with regards to backend and infrastructure, 
and to do so in a time efficient manner. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further instructions on how 
to view and test this demo.

.. note::

   This project, while production-ready, is for demonstration 
   purposes only. It is not designed for use with actual samples or data.
