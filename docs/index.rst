===================================

**LIMS Demo** is full-stack project, built and deployed over the course of **one week**, where 
I aimed to demonstrate my development capabilities by quickly and efficiently building a 
minimum viable product for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for instructions on how to view a live demo of this app, 
and a description of its core features.

.. note::

   While this project was a great exercise in understanding how a LIMS might be implemented, 
   designing a LIMS from scratch is probably not an efficient use of resources for most 
   biotech companies. Rather, an off-the-shelf LIMS that can be extended by in-house engineers 
   is likely more appropriate for anything other than either very simple or highly specific 
   lab data handling requirements.
