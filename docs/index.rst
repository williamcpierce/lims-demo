===================================

**LIMS Demo** is full-stack project, built and deployed over the 
course of **one week**, which aims to showcase a minimum viable product 
for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).
The intention behind this project is to demonstrate my development 
capabilities, especially with regards to backend and infrastructure, 
and to do so in a time efficient manner. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further instructions on how 
to view and test a live demo of this app.
