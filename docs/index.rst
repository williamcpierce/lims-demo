===================================

**LIMS Demo** is full-stack project, built and deployed over the 
course of **one week**, which aims to demonstrate my development 
capabilities by building a minimum viable product for a Laboratory 
Information Management System (LIMS).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further instructions on how 
to view and test a live demo of this app.

.. note::

   While this project was a great exercise in understanding how a 
   LIMS might be implemented, designing a LIMS is not an efficient 
   use of resources for most biotech companies. An off-the-shelf 
   LIMS that can be extended by in-house engineers is probably 
   more appropriate for anything other than either very simple or 
   highly specific lab data handling requirements.
