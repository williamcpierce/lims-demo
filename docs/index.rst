===================================

**LIMS Demo** is full-stack project, built and deployed over the course of **one week**, where 
I aimed to demonstrate my development capabilities by quickly and efficiently building a 
minimum viable product for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for instructions on how to view a live demo of this app, 
and a description of its core features.
